## [React Podcast](https://reactpodcast.simplecast.fm/)

Hosted by [@chantastic](https://twitter.com/chantastic), the React Podcast is a fantastic podcast that treats the listeners with great conversation about React with renowned developers. The podcast often goes into some technical depth, whether the conversation is new exciting technologies in the React sphere or the even the implementation details and motivations of their open source. A great podcast to listen to if you want to get better at developing in React and the different options you have.

## [Software Engineering Daily](https://www.softwaredaily.com/)

As an avid podcast listener, SE Daily is one of the first development related podcasts I started listening to, and it sparked the interest to find even more. SE Daily tends to have a focus on the backend, but you would be hard pressed to not find an abundance of episodes that interest you. The host [Jeff Meyerson](https://twitter.com/the_prion?lang=en) is impressive with ability to ask great technical questions, that creates a great discussion.

Some of my favourite episodes include:

-   [V8 Lite with Ross McIlroy](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/04/03/v8-lite-with-ross-mcilroy/)
-   [Facebook Messenger Engineering with Mohsen Agsen](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/03/31/facebook-messenger-engineering-with-mohsen-agsen/)
