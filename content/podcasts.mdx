# Podcasts

I am a massive podcast consumer and find that it is really beneficial in my development as a software engineer. Here are my favourite tech podcasts I regularly listen to:

## [Swift by Sundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/podcast/)

Swift by Sundell is the first tech podcast that I really started to enjoy and benefit from listening to. As the name suggests, Swift by Sundell is a podcast about Swift and more, hosted by the fabulous [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) with a range of fantastic guests. John is my favourite person in the Swift community, he creates unparalleled educational content with great depth and clarity. The podcast is no exception, John has a talent for discussing technical topics clearly and in great detail, in particular programming design for performant maintable Swift code.

## [React Podcast](https://reactpodcast.simplecast.fm/)

Hosted by [@chantastic](https://twitter.com/chantastic), the React Podcast is a fantastic podcast that treats the listeners with great conversation about React with renowned developers. The podcast often goes into some technical depth, whether the conversation is new exciting technologies in the React sphere or the even the implementation details and motivations of their open source. A great podcast to listen to if you want to get better at developing in React and the different options you have.

## [Software Engineering Daily](https://www.softwaredaily.com/)

As an avid podcast listener, SE Daily is one of the first development related podcasts I started listening to, and it sparked the interest to find even more. SE Daily tends to have a focus on the backend, but you would be hard pressed to not find an abundance of episodes that interest you. The host [Jeff Meyerson](https://twitter.com/the_prion?lang=en) is impressive with his ability to ask great technical questions, that creates a great discussion.

Some of my favourite episodes include:

-   [V8 Lite with Ross McIlroy](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/04/03/v8-lite-with-ross-mcilroy/)
-   [Facebook Messenger Engineering with Mohsen Agsen](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/03/31/facebook-messenger-engineering-with-mohsen-agsen/)

## [Chats with Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/chats-with-kent-podcast/)

Kent C. Dodds (or Kent Content Dodds as coined by [Domitrius Clark](https://twitter.com/domitriusclark?lang=en)) is very influential voice in the JavaScript community, as an educator and open source contributor. He is known for producing a lot of educational content on sites like [egghead.io](https://kcd.im/egghead), [Frontend Masters](https://kcd.im/fem) and of course his loved [TestingJavaScript.com](https://testingjavascript.com/). On this podcast he interviews a variety of developers in the community and talk about life, career and code. This is a great podcast if you want a mix of technical, whilst also improving your soft skills and refining your career/life direction.

## [Soft Skills Engineering](https://softskills.audio/)

Soft Skills Engineering is hosted by Dave and Jamison and has a much more casual vibe than most other tech podcasts. Dave and Jamison talk about the soft skills in software engineering covering topics such as pay raises, hiring and firing developers, technical leadership, learning new technologies, quitting your job, getting promoted, code review etiquette, and much more. They'll have you laughing before you know it and then all of a sudden be giving great advice from their years of experience. Whilst the questions may not always be relevant to you, I find them still to be very educational and will help you navigate your tech career.

## [egghead.io Podcast](https://egghead.io/podcasts)

[egghead.io](https://egghead.io/) is a fanatastic website that provides video tutorials on JavaScript tools and frameworks from industry professionals, so it only makes sense that their podcast is just as helpful. Each episode features a prominent JavaScript engineer in the industry and help the listener understand how they've had their success in their particular field.
