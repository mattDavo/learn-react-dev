# A Different Way to Style in React

I am still trying to figure out the best way to style components in a React application. There are so many options: CSS files, CSS modules, raw CSS in JS, or CSS in JS with libraries like [styled components](https://styled-components.com/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction). All of them have some great benefits, whilst they all have their issues.

At one end of the spectrum using normal globally scoped css files will generally be the best performance you can achieve, however can lead to a confusing codebase where it is unclear what styles are being used. Often resulting in bloated stylesheets containing way more rulesets than are actually used.

On the opposite end of the spectrum we have nice CSS in JS libraries like **styled components** which provide great locally scoped styles with a ton of useful functionality, allowing you to easily just define CSS rulesets as components. However, it also has its drawbacks, there are [some concerns with performance](https://medium.com/ansarada-thinking/styled-components-v4-the-good-the-bad-and-something-completely-different-e891139e0138), it does not promote using the beautiful cascading and composing nature of CSS, and masking of accessiblity issues.

```jsx
import React, { cloneElement, Children, isValidElement, Fragment } from 'react';

function ApplyStyle({ className, isActive, children }) {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      {Children.map(children, (child) => {
        if (
          isValidElement(child) &&
          (typeof isActive == 'undefined' || isActive === true)
        ) {
          const mergedClassName =
            (child.props.className || '') + ' ' + className;
          return cloneElement(child, { className: mergedClassName });
        }

        return child;
      })}
    </Fragment>
  );
}

export function Selected({ isActive, children }) {
  return ApplyStyle({ className: 'selected', isActive, children });
}

function Example() {
  <Selected>
    <span>Home</span>
  </Selected>;
}
```
