# V8 Lite with Ross McIlroy

## Podcast: [Software Daily](https://www.softwaredaily.com/post/5e86ffecf51b4a000c5aa9f2/V8-Lite-with-Ross-McIlroy)

Chrome if often the butt of a lot of jokes regarding its massive memory consumption, but by listening to this episode you will gain a better appreciation of what is going on behind the scenes for Chrome to run. You'll hear about the improvements made to V8, the javascript engine that runs Chrome, to improve your experience; especially on less powerful mobile devices. You will hear about their efforts to reduce memory consumption as well as their optimisation engine, TurboFan which is run on "hot" code paths. There isn't a whole lot more that I can say about this episode other than to just go and listen to it.

From the show notes:

> "V8 is running behind the scenes in your browser all the time, evaluating the code in your different tabs and determining how to manage that runtime in memory. As V8 is observing your code and analyzing it, V8 needs to allocate resources in order to determine what code to optimize. This process can be quite memory intensive, and can add significant overhead to the memory overhead of Chrome."
