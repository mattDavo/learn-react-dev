# Pod Review: Jen Luker, a11y champion

## Podcast: [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/podcasts/jen-luker-a11y-champion)

Hear from Jen Luker an accessibility (a11y) champion, who details how we can improve the accessibility of our progressive web apps and why we should do it. My notes from the episode:

-   15% of people are _**registered**_ as having disability, more in reality.
-   An accessible PWA widens your catchment of potential customers.
-   A11y is not just for people with disabilities but for people that want to use your site different, for example without a mouse.
-   Making an non-a11y site a11y can seem like a mountain to climb, but it's important to just start. A good way is to just make all new code a11y.
-   Whenever writing any documentation or examples, include the necessary accessibility tags. As developers we so frequently just copy code from examples, by having accessibility in our examples, people who use the examples are much more likely to include their own accessibility tags as well.
-   Use [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) or [Deque aXe](https://www.deque.com/axe/).
