## Notes

-   You need to become proficient at the thing you aspire to be paid to do rather than what you are currently paid to do.
-   https://fearlesssalarynegotiation.com/
-   Easiest way to successfully get raises is to already do the job you want, proving that you can do it. Then ask for the appropriate position as a result of work.
-   Always be thinking about how you can do your next job better.
-   It can be difficult to brag on yourself, better to brag on others and create a culture of recognising great work. This makes people want to work with you much more and also people will more often than not return the favour.
-   Make a journal of things you’ve accomplished, but don’t make it to much of a chore otherwise you’ll just get lazy and stop. Just simple things like, recognition, project expectations vs outcomes, how you made your bosses’ life easier.
    -   Store messages and emails in a folder, but remember to be discrete, you don’t really want it to appear obviously on screen for people to see if you’re sharing your screen.
-   When talking with the recruiter or whoever, do not reveal your current salary or your salary expectations. Say you are uncomfortable with revealing it and would like to focus how the value you can add to the new role.
-   When negating you don’t want to be deceitful or lie, it’s not the way to start a relationship, instead it should be a collaborative effort between you and the employer, this is both beneficial for you and them, whilst also demonstrating that you are easy to work with.
