    -   Following React's initial poor reception from the community, Pete Hunt explains the motivations behind React, frustrations with existing best practices and clears up the initial concerns with React.
    -   A key takeaway from this talk is that as programmers when thinking about separation of concerns we should avoid thinking of them as separation of technologies but rather separation of actual concerns. Pete highlights this in regard to templating, very much a flavour of the time.
