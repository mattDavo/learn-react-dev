# About 🚀

## Hey You! Welcome! 👊

Welcome to Recompiled[JT]S! Here you'll find articles written by Matt Davidson on anything related to learning frontend web development in javascript/ typescript with a focus on using ReactJS. Here you can join me on my journey to becoming the best web developers we can be. You will find original articles on fundamentals, links and reviews of other resources, using React libraries, options in tooling, and more! Contributions are welcomed and encouraged!

This not intended as an expert, extensive or "correct" guide for all things web, but instead a culmination and sharing of my own learning experiences on a journey to becoming the best web developer I can be.

## Site Direction 👉

My initial vision for this site was to just be a super React focused site, but early on in the initial building of the site I realised that while I was quite inexperienced with React development, there is so much I have to learn about web development in general. If I were to soley focus on React, I would be doing myself and any potential readers a disservice.

Furthermore, while it is currently 2020 and React continues to prove itself as the leader in new web development, I feel that it is better to build this site around web fundamentals, looking at all ways to do things, not just the React way. Because whilst I love React, there's always something else around the corner. Who knows, it could be you that builds it!

## Why "Recompiled[JT]S"?

When I was trying to think of a catchy meaningful name for the site, I couldn't think of one so I went with <Keyword>Recompiled[JT]S</Keyword> 😂

No, seriously, my vision behind the site is for it be both a progressional learning library, something you can read in order as a beginner and also just search and find some specific thing you are looking for. And most of it will be driven by own personal benefit. I hope to become a better web developer as I build this site. The idea is that by "compiling" lots of learning material, both my own and recommendations of others we can all get better.

**So, where does the "_Re_-compiled" come from?**

Well, if you know much about Chrome's javascript/WASM engine V8, then you would know that when the same segments are run many times they are known as "hot" code segments and then those segments are sent to TurboFan V8's optimizing compiler to improve performance. Likewise, by continually learning web development we'll become hot and become optimised!

Cheesy, I know! 😜

Oh, and yes, that's Regex in the name 🙃

## Building this site 👷🏻‍♂️

Whilst this is not the first site I have built in React, it will be the largest project that I have undertaken with it. I am using it as a learning opportunity to apply what I have learnt from my previous sites, while also practice the best React (and web) fundamentals and learn different ways to build in React.

I have chosen to build Let's Learn React with [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) after careful consideration. I originally started building it with just [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) but after rethinking how I wanted the content to be more 'static' and live in the repo as markdown (or as we use MDX), I considered Gatsby and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I did some reading, including [this great article](https://dev.to/jameesy/gatsby-vs-next-js-what-why-and-when-4al5) and I decided with Gatsby due to it being staticly rendered and being very impressed with how fast it is for the [ReactJS Docs](https://reactjs.org/). Whilst I am expecting this site to grow, I don't think it will hit the size of being too slow to build, which would've meant Next.js would've been the best choice.
