# About ðŸš€

Hey! Welcome!

Welcome to Let's Learn React! Here you'll find articles written by Matt Davidson on everything related to learning frontend web development in ReactJS. Here you can join me on my journey to becoming the best React developers we can be. You will find original articles on fundamentals, links and reviews of other resources, using React libraries, options in tooling, and more! Contributions are welcomed and encouraged!

This not intended as an expert, extensive or "correct" guide for all things React, but instead a culmination and sharing of my own learning experiences on a journey to becoming the best React developer I can be.

## Building this site

Whilst this is not the first site I have built in React, it will be the largest project that I have undertaken with it. I am using it as a learning opportunity to apply what I have learnt from my previous sites, while also practice the best React (and web) fundamentals and learn different ways to build in React.

I have chosen to build Let's Learn React with [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) after careful consideration. I originally started building it with just [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) but after rethinking how I wanted the content to be more 'static' and live in the repo as markdown (or as we use MDX), I considered Gatsby and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I decided with Gatsby due to it being staticly rendered and being very impressed with how fast it is for the [ReactJS Docs](https://reactjs.org/). Whilst I am expecting this site to grow, I don't think it will hit the size of being too slow to build, which would've meant Next.js would've been the best choice.
