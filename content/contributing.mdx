# Contributing

## Thanks for being interesting in contributing! 🙏🏻

This site is still very immature, so any and all contributions are welcomed. This can be anything from suggestions on what to add, fixing mistakes or writing your own content! You're welcome to make a pull request or raise an issue and I'll get back to you pronto, or you can contact [me](https://mattdavo.com) privately if that's more appealing.
